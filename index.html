          <h3>Web development ‚≠ê</h3>
          <p>
            I started learning web development from the 
            <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp</a>
            Udemy course because I was always interested in this field, pushed by my curiosity about how the internet and, more specific,
            websites really work "behind the scenes" and I wish to pursue a career in this field.

          <p>
            I have been taking part in a lot of competitive programming competitions during my four years of high school and this helped
            me learn my first programming language, namely C/C++. I am very comfortable with the C/C++ syntax, C++ libraries(especially 
            the Standard Template Library) and other more advanced topics, such as C++ Object Oriented Programming.

            I attended 
            <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/">Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python</a>
            in order to gain knowledge about one of the most powerful general-purpose programming languages, namely Python.
            I managed to complete the course and I am also looking forward to improving my knowledge in this field.

            I attended 
            <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/">Harvards's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science</a>,
            which is considered by many one of the best introductory Computer Science courses in the world and managed to complete
            it, improving my already strong foundation in the this field. I also gained a strong knowledge in problem
            solving, algorithms and data structures by participating in many prestigious competitive programming competitions, such as The Olympiad
            in Informatics.
